            <p>Ever since I was young, I had always have a knack for technology. </br>
                I had always wondered how a computer had worked. </br>
                This buring curiousity led me to pursuit Computer Science degree.
            </p>

            <p>If I could have traveled back in time, I would have told my younger self to be more ambitious.  </br> 
                The reason I didn't learned programming at a younger age was the thought of stereotype that was surrounding programming.  </br>
                Growing up all I heard about programming was "You need deep understanding of mathemathics before you can program." or "Programming is impossibly hard." </br>
                These words even though they are other's opinion had petrified my younger self.</p>
